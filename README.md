# J1007-2115.exe-Malware
remake of J100758.264+211529.207.exe. Made for educational purposes only, I'm not responsible for any damages. Credits to Wipet for HSL and credits to ArTicZera for the HSL Shader system, and credits to fr4ctalz for the shader (I modified it). If you want to use the source code in your malware, then your malware must be open source as well
